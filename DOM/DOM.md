### DOM (Document object model)
 ##### window   =>> this is lobal object 
 - window is not a part of javascript its is part of browser 
 - if we write consol.log(window) its show window object 
 - when we log our window so its show our html structure 
 - so here we use DOM on our document so we write directly document
    - eg : document.write("hellow")  s ots write hellow on screen
